<p><strong>Fruit Tree Addict:</strong> I just planted my fruit trees and now it&#39;s raining on them.</p>
<p><strong>Operator:</strong> Are in a safe place sir?</p>
<p><strong>Addict:</strong> I don&#39;t know it&#39;s raining.</p>
<p><strong>Operator:</strong> Where are you right now sir?</p>
<p><strong>Addict:</strong> I&#39;m next to one of the trees I planted.</p>
<p><strong>Operator:</strong> Do you have an umbrella in your hand sir?</p>
<p><strong>Addict:</strong> Yes, yes, … <em>(sobbing)</em> I&#39;m holding it over the tree so it doesn&#39;t get wet.</p>
<p><strong>Operator:</strong> Okay sir, remain calm, I&#39;m going to help you. Is there lightning in the area?</p>
<p><strong>Addict:</strong> Yes, everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Operator:</strong> Okay sir, I need you to move to a safe place. Can you put down the umbrella and get inside a house?</p>
<p><strong>Addict:</strong> Yes, … <em>(muffled sound)</em> I&#39;m in my house.</p>
<p><strong>Operator:</strong> Is there anyone in your house that can be with you?</p>
<p><strong>Addict:</strong> No, my wife and kids have gone to a PTA meeting. I&#39;m supposed to be there as well.</p>
<p><strong>Operator:</strong> Please sit down sir. I&#39;m familiar with this problem and I can help you. I need you to look at the photos on your phone. What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>Addict:</strong> I see trees and flowers and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Operator:</strong> Are there any photos of your wife or children on the phone sir?</p>
<p><strong>Addict:</strong> No, only the trees.</p>
<p><strong>Operator:</strong> This is normal sir, this is a common condition. I need you to make another check sir. Have a look at the list of the last 10 numbers that you dialed. Who were they to?</p>
<p><strong>Addict:</strong> They are to my local nurseries. Except for one of them which is to a guy from Facebook that going to give me a Mulberry Tree.</p>
<p><strong>Operator:</strong> Sir, when you call the tree nurseries do they immediately recognize your voice and greet you by name?</p>
<p><strong>Addict:</strong> Yes, always.</p>
<p><strong>Operator:</strong> We&#39;re going to get help over to you right now sir. In the meantime I would like you to go online and go to a support group. It&#39;s called <a href=\\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/589635491185478/\\">Fruit Trees Anonymous</a>. There are other people just like you who will be able to help you. Sit tight and we have someone on their way.</p>
<p><strong>Addict:</strong> Okay... <em>(sobbing)</em>.</p>
