# plant

A website app to manage backyard orchards and anything else you can grow
in your yard.

## Objectives

* Allow users to track the plants that they're growing.
  * Provide stats on growth rates.
  * Pull in weather information.
  * Compare against other growers.
* Allow users to research plants to grow.
  * Users can search within a radius of their location for plants others are
  growing.
  * Users can determine likelihood of success.
* Assist users in management of their plants.
  * Send alerts to users when action needs to be taken based on time-of-year
  or on weather. For example, should prune/fertilize on X Date, or "there's
  a freeze warning, you need to protect your avocado tree."
* Usability
  * Users should be able to post entries about a tree from their yard on a smart
  phone.
  * Users should be able to take photos and add them to a plant entry from
  their smart phone while making a post.
  * Users should be able to operate the app while disconnected with syncing
  done later.

plants in different locations.
* Allow users to add parentage/genealogy to their plants.
  * i.e. if another user gave them a plant or they planted another plant from
  one that they're already documenting on the system then they can link a parent
  plant.

  radius of their location.
